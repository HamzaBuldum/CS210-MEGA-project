# CS210-MEGA-project
# Tesla Data Analysis

## Objective
This project aims to analyze driving patterns and energy efficiency using data collected from my Tesla Model Y. By leveraging the Tesla APP and Tessie, I will explore trends in energy consumption, identify driving behavior patterns based on my daily life data(i.e. youtube music), and assess charging habits.

## Data
- **Source**: Tesla DATA and Tesla App logs and Tessie app.
- **Details**:
  - State of Charge (SOC), energy consumption, GPS coordinates, speed, and climate conditions.
  - Charging session details and efficiency.
  - music history

## Plan
1. **Data Collection**: Use Tesla API and Tessie to gather vehicle data.
2. **Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key metrics.
3. **Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards to display driving routes, energy trends, and charging efficiency.
4. **Machine Learning**: Implement predictive models to estimate range based on driving conditions.
5. **Insights and Reporting**: Summarize findings and prepare a final report or video.

## Tools
- Python: `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- GitHub: For version control and project hosting.
- Google Collab : For data analysis and visualization.
